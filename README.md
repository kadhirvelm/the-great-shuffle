# The tower of cultivation

## Technical exploration

I'm attempting to define the constraints of a world and get ChatGPT to generate all the fun bits, like the story, powers, loot and what not. What we're aiming for here is a lot of freedom to explore with different combinations of skills and the excitement of seeing what the AI generates

## Game breakdown

The player takes on the role of a new cultivator looking to ascend the mysterious tower. The player first chooses one of three weapons: hand wraps, a sword, or a spear. They then go through the basic tutorial teaching them how to jump, attack, and defeat monsters.

They next identify the cultivation path they want to purse, where the player has the freedom to explore whatever inspired element(s) they want. The game then generates a helpful list of "paths" they can purse related to this element. Each path will have a different set of powers that the character will get, however all paths will have the same basic 3 categories:

1. An enforcement technique - that improves their characters stats and skills in a specific way
2. A short range aura blast - that attacks all monsters in an area surrounding the area
3. A long ranged attack - that blasts forward attacking monsters that are far away

The game has access to lots of different aspects that govern the system the game takes place in, which will reflect in the effects of the weapon with the path.

## Game play
Once the player has their weapon and their path selected, they begin the climb. Each level more or less breaks down the same way. There are a number of enemies on the floor that need to be defeated. Once defeated, the player will be able to advance further up the tower.

Every level has a distinct personality to it (color, monsters, and ideally music) and will provide a boost to the player. That could come in the form of a new weapon, consumables, power upgrades, etc. In addition, the player will level up each time they defeat all the monsters, which will allocate them an extra stat point and skill point they can allocate to their character's stats and powers.

The monsters will get bigger and stronger as the levels climb, but so will the player.

## Things to figure out later

* Rogue-like? Do we want to make things easier in subsequent runs?
* How many levels do we go up?
* Do we want boss fights?
