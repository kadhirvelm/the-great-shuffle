## How to play

### Overview
The great shuffle is a team-based competitive game where two teams vie to accumulate the most points before time runs out. The team with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.

### Objective
Players aim to collect specific artifacts to earn points for their team. Each player is assigned a unique mission to retrieve a designated artifact. Successfully completing this mission by possessing the correct artifact at the game's conclusion scores points for their team.

### Starting the Game:
Players are randomly distributed across various locations within the game area.
These locations correspond to real-world locations that players must physically travel to.

### Artifacts and Locations:
Each location contains an artifact that players can collect.
Upon arriving at a location, players are presented with a set of options, each leading to a different location.

### Missions and Scoring:
Each player is assigned a mission to retrieve a specific artifact.
Points are awarded to the team based on the number of players who successfully complete their missions.
Up to 10 points can be scored, depending on mission completions.

### Player Interaction:
Players can only communicate and trade artifacts with others who are present at the same location.
Each player can carry only one artifact at a time.

### Movement Restrictions:
Not all players will have access to all locations, creating strategic challenges.

### Team Discovery:
Players are initially unaware of their team alignments.
Identifying team members is a crucial part of the strategy as the game progresses.

### Winning the Game
The team with the most points at the end of the allotted time is declared the winner. Strategic collaboration, effective communication, and successful mission completions are key to securing victory in the great shuffle.
